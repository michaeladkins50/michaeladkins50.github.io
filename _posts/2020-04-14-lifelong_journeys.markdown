The question on everyones mind is why am I going back to school. Let me take you back to a land far far away. Ok, it isn't that far away but is was a while ago. I grew up in a suberb of Detroit, Michigan... Taylor, Michigan to be exact. I was going to high school and like most of us, I had no idea of what I wanted to be when I grew up. One thing I had an interest in was flying. I figured I would try to become a pilot. 

You remember the days in high school where you send interests to prospective colleges hoping to see who accepts you? I did that, and got ccepted by two schools. One in Detroit for engineering and one in Florida for flying. Well, a funny thing happened at the time. I recieved the Michigan Competitive Scholorship but it was only good for a college or university in Michigan. So, you guessed it, I went to school in Detroit. The one thing that I realized from going to the University of Detroit is.....I wasn't ready. High school had been a breeze. I would usually get all my work done in school. I never had homework. Not a a good approach to take when everything I had to do **WAS HOMEWORK**! I didn't do so well. I dropped out and went to a school where all my older brothers had gone. THe National Institute of Technology. There it was a straight 18 month program and I earned my Associates in Electronic Engineering Technology. 

"Wait wait...I thought you were going to tell us why you decided to go back to school?". I am, please bear with me a few more sentances. Let's jump forward in time to the present. I took the industrial side of electrical in school so when I got out I worked  jobs for companies that serve the auto industry. Automation, packaging, injection molding machines, paint automation, etc. People like to let you believe that working in the auto industry is a great path to take and it is with a few exceptions. It is a very volitile industy. Everything cycles for 5 years at a time. Projects are launched based on new models so suppliers to that are slways in fear because of the contracts to win or lose. 

That brings us pretty much up to date. I have worked in an industry that pays decent but I never loved. I have grown up with the evolution of computers from the Vic 20, yes I do still wish I had that, to the smart phones we have today. I remember the dos class I had in high school, playing with HTML and JS when it was still young. Computers has always been in my vocabulary and now that the field has opened up to where I don't have to go to school for 4 years. I am all in.

**Coding is the future...My future.**
