If you were like me, you do or did tutorials on js, html, css, ruby. I am asking you not to. There are some decent resources out there to get famiar with coding. Sites like SoloLearn, Grass Hopper, etc. They offer an easy approch to looking at code and telling you what happens. There is one major flaw. Looking at code does not help you become a programmer. Writing code is the only way to get there. Those sites draw you in by the ease at which you can get through them. 

**Maybe you are asking, "Well, Einstein, what do you recommend for us to do?". **


Download VSCode, Atom, whatever enviroment you like. Then not only check out the "Free" tutorials, but write code. Put what they show you to the test. I guarantee you that you will be that much further ahead when you decide to go to a coding school. 

**Coding School....Why would I do that when I can take the "Free Tutorials?".**

Let's be honest. Free coding classes is great and all. I wouldn't be in Coding School right now if it wasn't for those type of platforms. I can let you in on a little secret. Those platforms have only showed me about 2% of where I am in the learning process. I am a month in and there have been times that my mind was blown with the complexities of abstraction. Concepts like 'Has Many' and "Belongs To" is something I struggled with. Object Relationships and how to tie classes together can be tricky but extremely easy at the same time. The biggest one I got stuck on was literally trying to be abstact when the solution was a literal. If it asks you to return the output then sometimes that is all you need to do.

I could tell you more but I probably have confused you even more. Abstration is an art, one you can master. Think of it kid of like this. You are on the freeway, maybe doing the speed limit. What has to happen for you to be able to do the speed limit? Well, first you have to be driving a car. You have to have the car in drive. You have to have your hands on the steering wheel, foot on the gas and not on the brake. These are all object relationships and abstract thought as well. Like having yours eyes open so you can see where you are going. 

I will leave you with this completely random Blog Post to ponder. I started with the title of the things I wish I had known but I am ending in a different direction. Very Abstact of if I do say so myself.
