Projects. It's the life of a Software Developer. Writing code is who we are, what we are aiming to become. Flatiron has put on on this path with their challenging curriculum. One month in and here you go, write a Cli program that will gather information from an API and sort through the data for a user to make further requests on. 

**Wait, What....**

I will admit, that is what went through my mind when I came to this project. Code alongs and test based programming is challenging but the stress level that went through my head was 10 times a million worse when it came time to start this. 

**Blank screen, Blank screen, Blank screen...**

Ok, where do I start. Lets look at the videos in the Final Project Folders...Lets look at the links that the cohort lead left on the Study Groups Videos. That's the information I need. Ok, make sure that I am clear on the requirements again. 

**Hey, I have something on the screen...**

This code was challenging, it introduced new code that I was unfamiliar with. Rest-client and JSON. It didn't become clear until I actuall plugged it into co and looked at the results to see what was coming in. rest client brings everthing in as a string and JSON parses it into an array of hashes. Everything a good class need to be able to iterate over the data. I sat for more hours than I care to admit staring at a blank code box than I would like to admit. It wasn't that I didn't know how to do things in programming it, it was more about a mental block that was preventing me from trying. I had to force myself to do one line at a time, asking myself what the program needed nextWhat output do I need, What input do I need. Once I got the api.rb file going, it is the file name that I used to handle all the web requests. The rest of the program seemed to write itself. I created a MovieSeries class to save all the information that came from the api. The last part of the puzzle was the actual Cli. I take that back because I did need a small section of the Cli to make the api work. The program I wrote gathers the User input to be annotated to the website URL in order to gather the information from the website. After I had that small section I wrote the Api class then the MovieSeries class and went back to the Cli class to create the User experience. 

I hope you get clues about how to go about writing your projects from this. The information about how to write it is there. Getting past the "Blank Screen" is the key. To see a video of the finished product:
